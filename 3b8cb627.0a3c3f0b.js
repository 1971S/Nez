This makes having lots of lights more efficient. The general gist of how it works is like this: first, we render all objects to a diffuse render texture and render their normal maps to a normal render texture simultaneously (via multiple render targets). All of the lights are then rendered using the normal data into a 3rd render texture. Finally, the light render texture and the diffuse render texture are combined for the final output.

Self illuminated portions of your texture don't need to have a light hit them for them to be visible. They are always lit. You can specify which portions of your texture should be self illuminated via the alpha channel of your normal map. A 0 value indicates no self illumination and a value of 1 indicates fully self illuminated. Don't forget that premultiplied alpha must not be used when using self illumination! Nez needs that alpha channel intact to get the self illumination data. When using self illumination you have to let Nez know by setting ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"DeferredSpriteMaterial.SetUseNormalAlphaChannelForSelfIllumination"),".
