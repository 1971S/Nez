You add one or more Renderers to your Scene (",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"AddRenderer")," and ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"RemoveRenderer")," methods) and each of your Renderers will be called after all Entities/Components have had their update method called.

The Scene contains a RenderableComponents field that contains all the RenderableComponents for easy access and filtering.

By default, RenderableComponents are sorted RenderLayer and then by LayerDepth for fine-grained render order control. This is overrideable allowing you to sort however you want (see below). The Renderer class provides a solid, configurable base that lets you customize various attributes as well as render to a ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"RenderTexture")," instead of directly to the backbuffer. If you do decide to render to a RenderTexture in most cases you will want to use a ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"PostProcessor")," to draw it later. It should also be noted that RenderTextures on a Renderer are automatically resized for you when the screen size changes.

You can set the dirty flag for any RenderLayer via ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Scene.RenderableComponents.SetRenderLayerNeedsComponentSort"),". For example, if you are doing an isometric game and sorting based on the y-value of the Entity's Transform you would need to call ",Object(a.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Scene.RenderableComponents.SetRenderLayerNeedsComponentSort")," whenever the Entity moves on the y-axis."),Object(a.b)("h2",{id:"post-processors"},"Post Processors"),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Much like Renderers, you can add one or more PostProcessors to the Scene via the ",Object(a.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"AddPostProcessor")," and ",Object(a.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"RemovePostProcessor")," methods.
