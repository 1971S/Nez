Samples
==========

The Nez-Samples repository consists of a bunch of bite-sized samples detailing how to work with the various subsystems available in Nez. In order to get them running happily you need to do the following:

- clone the repo and ensure the subrepository is also updated (the main Nez repo is added as submodule)
- open Nez/Nez.sln and build that first. This is required so that the NuGet packages are downloaded
- now you can open the Samples/Samples.sln and run any of the projects in there

As of this writing all the samples are Mac projects. In the future we will include builds for the other platforms as well.
